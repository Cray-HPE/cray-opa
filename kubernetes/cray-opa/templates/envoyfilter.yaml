This file is adapted from this example:
https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa-envoy-plugin/blob/c1b006f3f2dc551a3532a16dbf817874eb1b7aa5/examples/istio/quick_start.yaml#L1-L39

The non-obvious adjustments are:
* Set context to GATEWAY since this applies to the ingressgateway
* Set the OPA request timeout to avoid failures
* Removed the `with_request_body` section. Our policy doesn't need the request body and it causes requests to fail.
